# Data Structures and Algorithm ReadMe

**Overview**

This repository is a collection of my favorite/most useful projects I completed in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. All the code in written in C++ and utilizes all principle data structures. This repository demonstrates proficiency in algorithmic thinking and problem solving as well as overall understanding of advanced computer science topics.


**Project Descriptions**


TravelingSalesman.zip - This project will calculate the shortest path for a salesman to travel from each city provided in the cities text file that is included in the project folder. This is done by using tspRefine recursively to refine a path given a map of coordinates which demonstrates understanding of refine algorithms and map based algorithms.


WordLadder.zip - This project will provide a ladder of words which connect two words, inputted by the user, by listing all steps needed to take by changing one letter at a time. Another constraint of the path words is it must be a valid word given from a list of valid 5 letter words in the corresponding text file in the project folder.


minHeap.cpp - This is a standard implementation of a minHeap. This common data structure can be utilizied in many different situations, but most importantly its use in optimization. This understanding of heaps, BSTs, trees, stacks, queues, and other common data structures provides a strong foundation in my understanding of programming.


nQueens.cpp - Using recursion to solve the common n-Queens problem. Essentially, the program will calculate how many safe states the game board can be with a chess queen in each row. The queens in a safe state can not be in danger from any other queen on the board. This program demonstrates knowledge of recursion and how to apply it in solving complex problems.


waterJugs.cpp - This program uses breadth-first search to solve the common water jug problem where jug A has a maximum capacity of 3 and jug B has maximum capacity of 4. This shows knowledge in the field of utlizing maps, predecessors, neighboring states, and standard search algorithm practices.


wolfGoatCabbage.cpp - This program is similar to the waterJugs program in how the search is completed (breadth-first search), except this program utilizes bit and bit-manipulation basics.



**Collaborations**

All of these programs were made by myself with the exception of certain test cases or starter information being provided by my professor.
